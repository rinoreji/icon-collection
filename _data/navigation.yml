- title: Official Azure Icon Set
  url: azure-icons
  desc: This set is the official downloadable collection from the [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/icons/), the best place to look if you're after an Azure service or common Azure related icon. The set has been flattened (no sub-directories) and superfluous prefixes removed from the filenames
  
- title: Azure Docs
  url: azure-docs
  desc: Scraped from main Azure docs site, all major Azure services are in here plus a couple of other useful icons. It's a smallish set and a good place to start if you require an icon for a top level Azure service.
